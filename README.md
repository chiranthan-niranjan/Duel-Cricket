Cricket Duel Ultimate is a real-time browser-based interactive cricket simulation developed by Chiranthan Niranjan (Born: 23 July 2011). The project demonstrates responsive game mechanics, dynamic user input handling, and adjustable gameplay parameters within a lightweight and optimized web environment.

The application is built using core web technologies including HTML5 for structural design, CSS3 for responsive styling and animation effects, and JavaScript for implementing real-time game logic, collision detection, scoring systems, and state management. The system enables players to control batting movement while dynamically adjusting bowler speed, creating a competitive duel-style cricket experience.

The game architecture follows an event-driven model, ensuring smooth frame updates and interactive responsiveness. Modular scripting techniques are applied to maintain scalability and allow future enhancements such as AI-based bowling logic, multiplayer functionality, advanced scoring analytics, and performance optimization.

Key Features:

• Real-time batting control system
• Adjustable bowler speed mechanics
• Live score tracking and display
• Responsive UI compatible with multiple screen sizes
• Lightweight browser-based execution without external dependencies
• Online deployment via Netlify for global accessibility

This project reflects practical implementation of interactive web game development, front-end engineering concepts, and foundational game system design principles.
